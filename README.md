## My journey 

In this repo, you will find my journey in learning machine learning. I will be using the [PHP-ML](https://php-ml.org/) library to learn the basics of machine learning. I will be using the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework to build a simple web application to test the machine learning algorithms.

### Why I am learning machine learning

I have been fascinated by machine learning for a while now. I have been reading about it and (ab)using already existing AIs, such as [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), [Computer Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/vision-services) and have had a lot of fun transforming me into a [LoTR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings) character. <br>
But this is not sufficient, enough, for me. I've always been a curious and a creative person. I want to know how these things work. I want to know how to build them. I also wish that, someday, I can build something that can help people. People like me, who struggle with speaking "correctly" with non-intimate people. <br>

## What I plan to do

I plan to build a simple web application that will be able to detect the tone of a text. The application will be able to detect if the text is positive, negative or neutral. <br>
Or, at least, this is the first step I want to achieve in my journey.
